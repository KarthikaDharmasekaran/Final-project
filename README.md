  Problem: Analyze sentiments in healthcare reviews.

   Objective: Develop a model to classify sentiments.

  Tasks:
     Data Preprocessing
     Sentiment Analysis Model
     Model Evaluation
     Insights & Visualization

*** goals***
     The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify sentiments in healthcare reviews. This involves analyzing text data from healthcare reviews and determining whether the sentiment expressed in each review is positive, negative, or neutral.

***Task***
    ***1) Data Preprocessing**: This task involves cleaning and preparing the text data from healthcare reviews. It includes tasks like text tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling any missing data.

   ***2)Sentiment Analysis Model***: Develop a machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) model that can classify sentiments in healthcare reviews. This model should be able to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.

   ***3)Model Evaluation***: Assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step is crucial to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

  ***4)Insights & Visualization***: After building and evaluating the model, generate insights from the sentiment analysis results. Visualize the data and findings to communicate the results effectively.

***requrement Text***:
     import pandas as pd
     import numpy as np
     import seaborn as sns
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      %matplotlib inline
     import re

     import warnings
     warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

***Conclusion***
     using the Sentiment Analysis we can insights and see the some of the charts like seaborn,matplotlib
 and analysis which classify give more accuracy value KNN is the best method give high accuracy value and positive review is more compare to neutral and negative in the given Dataset in heathcare_review .csv.
